// Question 119: Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times ?
// Explain & TIP: A while loop continues to run as long as its condition remains true.
// Itâ€™s ideal for when you want to repeat something until a certain condition changes
// Answer 119:
let greetings = "Hello World!";
let flag = true;
while (flag) {
    console.log(greetings);
    console.log(greetings);
    console.log(greetings);
    console.log(greetings);
    console.log(greetings);
    flag = false;
}
