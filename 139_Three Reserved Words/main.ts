// Question 139: List three reserved words in JavaScript and create a valid use case for each ?

// Explain & TIP: Reserved words in JavaScript are words that have a special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers
// (e.g., variable names, function names).Understanding these can help prevent syntax errors and
// make your code more readable

// Answer 139:

let alphabets = "abc"

console.log(alphabets)

function true_false (){

    if(alphabets === "ABC"){console.log("These are first three alphabets in uppercase")}
    else{console.log("these are first three alphabets in lowercase")}
}

true_false()
