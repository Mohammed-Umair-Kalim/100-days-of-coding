// Question 131: Create two modules; one that exports a class, and another that imports the class and creates an instance?

// Explain & TIP: Classes can be modularized in the same way as functions. This encapsulation and
// reusability is a cornerstone of modern JavaScript application structure.

// Importing class:
import { person } from "./class_exp";

let Umair = new person ("Umair");

Umair.greetings()
